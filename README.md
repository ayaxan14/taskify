# taskify
My first (complete) project using React/Vite and tailwindcss, yes my back is in alot of pain, but it's finally done, and i learnt alot from it. It's not perfect, but damn i'm proud of the confetti.The project as a whole definitely took longer than needed, but i refuse to just copy a tutorial, so i ended up making my own. It's just a simple to do list app, i'll definitely update it in the future, since i need to add local storage, maybe a focus timer or dates, but for now i'm moving on, so i stay interested and dont burn out. It was an interesting move from python down to web development again, but i knew i needed to master it, for my ultimate project, coming soon... (muahaha)
