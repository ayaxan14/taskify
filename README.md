# taskify
My first (complete) project using React/Vite and tailwindcss, yes my back is in alot of pain, but it's finally done, and i learnt alot from it. It's not perfect, but damn i'm proud of the confetti. It was an interesting move from python down to web development again, but i knew i needed to master it, for my ultimate project, coming soon...
